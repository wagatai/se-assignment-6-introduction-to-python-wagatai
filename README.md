To activate the virtual environment, type source myvenv/bin/activate. deactivate the virtual environment, type deactivate.
Python Syntax and Semantics: A simple Python program that prints “Hello, World!” to the console can be written as follows:
print("Hello, World!")
The basic syntax elements used in this program are:
Indentation: Python uses indentation to define code blocks, such as classes, functions, and In this example, the print() statement is indented, which indicates that it is part of the main program.
Print statement: The print() function is used to output text to the console. In this case, it prints the string “Hello, World!” followed by a newline character.

4. Data Types and Variables:
   - List and describe the basic data types in Python. Write a short script that demonstrates how to create and use variables of different data types.
   Data Types and Variables: Python has several built-in data types, including:
Integers: Whole numbers, such as 1, 2, and 3.
Floats: Decimal numbers, such as 3.14, -2.5, and 0.5.
Strings: Sequences of characters, such as “hello”, ‘world’, and “”“This is a multiline string”"".
Boolean: Values that can be either True or False.
Here’s a short script that demonstrates how to create and use variables of different data types:
# Define variables of different data types
my_integer = 5
my_float = 3.14
my_string = "Hello, World!"
my_bool = True

# Print the values of the variables
print("Integer:", my_integer)
print("Float:", my_float)
print("String:", my_string)
print("Boolean:", my_bool)

5. Control Structures:
   - Explain the use of conditional statements and loops in Python. Provide examples of an `if-else` statement and a `for` loop.
Control Structures: Control structures in Python allow you to control the flow of your program. The most common control structures are conditional statements and loops.
Conditional Statements: These allow you to execute different blocks of code based on whether a condition is true or false. The most common type of conditional statement is the “if-else” statement. Here’s an example:
# Check if a number is even
num = 10

if num % 2 == 0:
 print(num, "is even.")
else:
 print(num, "is odd.")
Loops: These allow you to repeat a block of code a specified number of times or until a certain condition is met. The most common type of loop is the “for” loop. Here’s an example:
# Print the numbers from 1 to 5 using a for loop
for i in range(1, 6):
 print(i)

6. Functions in Python:
   - What are functions in Python, and why are they useful? Write a Python function that takes two arguments and returns their sum. Include an example of how to call this function.
   Functions in Python: Functions in Python are blocks of code that can be called and executed whenever you need to perform a specific task. They are useful because they allow you to reuse code, make your programs more modular, and make it easier to understand and debug your code. Here’s an example of a Python function that takes two arguments and returns their sum:
def add_two_numbers(a, b):
 return a + b

# Call the function and print the result
result = add_two_numbers(3, 5)
print(result)  # Output: 8

7. Lists and Dictionaries:
   - Describe the differences between lists and dictionaries in Python. Write a script that creates a list of numbers and a dictionary with some key-value pairs, then demonstrates basic operations on both.
Lists and Dictionaries: Lists and dictionaries are both data structures in Python.
Lists: Lists are ordered collections of elements, which can be of any data type, including other lists. They are denoted by square brackets and elements are separated by commas. Here’s an example:
# Create a list of numbers
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Demonstrate basic operations on the list
print("Original list:", my_list)
my_list.append(6)
print("After appending:", my_list)
Dictionaries: Dictionaries are unordered collections of key-value pairs. They are denoted by curly braces and key-value pairs are separated by commas. Here’s an example:
# Create a dictionary with some key-value pairs
my_dict = {"name": "John", "age": 25, "gender": "Male"}

# Demonstrate basic operations on the dictionary
print("Original dictionary:", my_dict)
my_dict["country"] = "USA"
print("After adding a new key-value pair:",

8. Exception Handling:
   - What is exception handling in Python? Provide an example of how to use `try`, `except`, and `finally` blocks to handle errors in a Python script.
   Exception Handling: Exception handling in Python allows you to handle and recover from unexpected errors that may occur during the execution of your program. It consists of three types of blocks: “try”, “except”, and “finally”.
Try block: This block contains the code that may raise an exception.
Except block: This block contains the code that will be executed if an exception is raised in the try block.
Finally block: This block contains the code that will always be executed, regardless of whether an exception was raised or not. Here’s an example of how to use “try”, “except”, and “finally” blocks to handle errors in a Python script:
# Define a function that divides two numbers and returns their quotient
def divide(num1, num2):
 try:
 result = num1 / num2
 except ZeroDivisionError:
 print("Error: Division by zero is not allowed.")
 else:
 print("Quotient:", result)
 finally:
 print("Division completed.")

# Call the function with valid and invalid inputs
divide(10, 2)
divide(10, 0)

9. Modules and Packages:
   - Explain the concepts of modules and packages in Python. How can you import and use a module in your script? Provide an example using the `math` module.
   Modules and Packages: In Python, a module is a file containing Python code that can be imported into a program. It is a way to organize and reuse code. A package is a collection of related modules and subpackages. It is a way to organize and distribute code.
To import and use a module in your script, you need to follow these steps:
Import the module: You can import a module using the import keyword followed by the name of the module. For example, to import the math module, you would write import math.
Access the module’s functions and variables: After importing a module, you can access its functions and variables using the dot notation. For example, to use the sqrt function from the math module, you would write math.sqrt().
Here’s an example using the math module:

# Calculate the square root of a number
result = math.sqrt(25)
print(result)

# Calculate the sine of a number
result = math.sin(45)
print(result)

10. File I/O:
    - How do you read from and write to files in Python? Write a script that reads the content of a file and prints it to the console, and another script that writes a list of strings to a file.
    File I/O: In Python, you can read from and write to files using the built-in open function, which returns a file object. The file object has two methods: read() and write(), which allow you to read from and write to the file, respectively.
Here are two examples:
Example 1: Read from a file and print it to the console:
with open('file.txt', 'r') as f:
    content = f.read()
    print(content)
Example 2: Write a list of strings to a file:
with open('file.txt', 'w') as f:
    for item in ['Hello', 'World!', 'This', 'is', 'a', 'test.']:
        f.write(item + '\n')
Note: In the second example, the with open() statement is used with the 'w' mode to create a new file or overwrite an existing one. The for loop iterates over the list of strings and writes each string followed by a newline character ('\n') to the file.
